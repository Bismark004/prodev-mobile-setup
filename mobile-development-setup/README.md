# Mobile Development Setup

This repository documents the setup process for mobile development using **React Native** and **Expo Go**.

## Tools Installed
- **Node.js LTS**: [Downloaded and installed](https://nodejs.org/).
- **VS Code**: [Downloaded and installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Expo CLI**: Installed globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- **Expo Go**: Installed on my physical device (Android/iOS).

## Steps to Set Up Expo Go
1. Installed **Expo Go** on my phone:
   - Android: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent).
   - iOS: [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779).
2. Created a new Expo project:
   ```bash
   expo init MyApp

### **Additional Notes**
challenge 1: QR Code scanning didn't work initially
- solution: Ensured that both my phone and PC were on the same WI-FI network

challenge 2: Slow performance on the physical device.
solution: Closed unnecessary apps on my phone to free up resources

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed mobile development setup"
  git push origin main
